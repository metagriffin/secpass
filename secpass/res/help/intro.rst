Currently, you are in the "config" command (usually invoked with
"secpass config" or "secnote config"), where you can manage the
profiles that you have (i.e. where and how to store sets of passwords
and encrypted notes). If this is not what you intended to do, hold the
"Control" key down and press "C" (otherwise called "Control-C" or "^C"
for short) to exit.

If, at any prompt you need more help, type "?" and press the "Enter"
or "Return" key. If that still does not give you enough information,
go to the URL https://pypi.python.org/pypi/secpass in a browser.
