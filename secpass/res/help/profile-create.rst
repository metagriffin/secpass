OK, now that we've completed this client's details, we can start the
configuration of the secure passwords and notes themselves. A single

group is called a "profile", which determines where the passwords and
notes are stored and how they are accessed. A SecPass configuration
must have at least one profile, so let's go ahead and configure one
