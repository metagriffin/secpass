Every client in a SecPass network has an associated "risk level".
This refers to the likelihood that someone may gain unauthorized
access to your device. For example, a mobile device such as a
smartphone should probably have a "high" risk level since it is easily
lost or stolen. The higher the risk level, the less the client can do
without being noticed and potentially blocked from further
transactions (equivalent to a "remote wipe"). So, choose the risk
level carefully -- the more conservative, the better.
