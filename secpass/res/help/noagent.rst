SecPass requires access to a gpg-agent process that has at least one
private key. This is needed in order to encrypt and decrypt sensitive
information (such as SPBP credentials and private cryptographic
keys). You either don't have one running, don't have your environment
configured so that SecPass can communicate with it, or did not grant
it access to encrypt/decrypt data. Please address this issue and try
again.
