The risk level that this client poses to being lost,
stolen, or otherwise compromised. Note that this value is generally
only used when initially connecting to networked services; after
that, the risk level needs to be changed at the networked service's
level. Valid values are "high-risk", "medium-risk", "low-risk", and
"unbreakable". Generally speaking, setting this value conservatively
(i.e. "higher") is better as it protects your entries better.
