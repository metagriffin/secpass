Creating a new account on Opiyum.net is simple: you register with your
email address and a password (one of the last ones you will ever need
to remember). Registration with an email address is required so that
Opiyum can send you confirmation requests on actions that require
two-factor authorization. Later, you can configure exactly how and
when authorizations are requested.
