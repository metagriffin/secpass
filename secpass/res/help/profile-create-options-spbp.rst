Networked storage via the SecPass Broker Protocol requires an account
on a central server; this allows distributed access to your secure
passwords and notes from any device that you authorize. If you don't
have an account that supports SPBP, Opiyum.net (the creators of
secpass) supports automatic creation of free SPBP accounts.
