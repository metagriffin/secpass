Secure Passwords
================

The **SecPass** suite of programs, tools, and protocols is designed to
allow fairly easy creation, distribution, rotation, and management of
very secure passwords in the most secure manner possible, without
compromising ease-of-use too much.

Please note that the ``secpass`` library only provides low-level
drivers and command-line tools. If you are interested in a more
user-friendly interface, please try the `SecPass-GUI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/secpass_gui>`_ package.


.. WARNING::

  2013/12/27: The SecPass package is currently under active
  development, i.e. it is not ready for use. Unless you like living on
  the edge, of course. So, until further notice, SecPass is explicitly
  in "beta" (at best), functionally incomplete, but can do some things
  at times reliably. You should only use it if you make lots of
  backups and don't mind losing data. Cheers!


TL;DR
=====

Install:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install secpass
  $ secpass --help
