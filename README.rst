Secure Passwords
================

.. warning::

  2013/08/16: The `Secure Passwords` (package ``secpass``) is
  currently under active development, i.e. it is not really ready for
  use. Unless you like living on the edge, of course.  So, everything
  from here on is "beta" **at best** and **use at your own risk**.
  Cheers!

TL;DR
=====

Install:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install secpass
